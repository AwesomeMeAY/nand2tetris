Boolean Values:
	True/False
	1/0
Boolean Operations:
	AND operator:
		takes two signals and returns 1 only if both signals are 1
	OR operator:
		takes two signals and returns 1 if at least one of the signals is 1
	NOT operator:
		takes one signal and returns the opposite of it
Booleans Expressions:
	NOT(0 OR (1 AND 1)) = NOT(0 OR 1) = NOT(1) = 0
Booleans Functions:
	f(a,b,c) = (a AND b) OR (NOT(a) AND Z)
	finite amount of possible values:
		Possible to write them down on "Truth Tables"	
Booleans Identities:
	Commutative Law:
		(a AND b) = (b AND a)		
		(a OR b) = (b OR a) 
	Associative Law:
		(a AND (b AND c)) = ((a AND b) AND c)
		(a OR (b OR c)) = ((a OR b) OR c)
	Distributive Law:
		(a AND (b OR c) = (a AND b) OR (a AND c)
		(a OR (b AND c)) = (a OR b) AND (a OR c)
	De Morgan Law:
		NOT(a AND b) = NOT(a) OR NOT(b)	
		NOT(a OR b) = NOT(a) AND NOT(b)
	Idempotence Law:
		a AND a = a
	Double Negation:
		NOT(NOT(a)) = a
