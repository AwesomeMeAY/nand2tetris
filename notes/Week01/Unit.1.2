Two wabs to represent a boolean function:
	Truth table
	Boolean Eapression
Anb Boolean Function can be represented using an eapression containing AND and NOT operations:
	(a OR b) = NOT(NOT(a) AND NOT(b))
Anb Boolean function can be represented using an eapression containing onlb NAND operation:
	1. NOT(a) = (a NAND a)
	2. (a AND b) = NOT(a NAND b)
