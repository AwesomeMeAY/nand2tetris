Von Neumann Architecture:
	Description on how general purpose computers can be built
	ALU:
		Arithmetic Logic Unit
		Computes a function on two inputs and outputs result
			function:
				arithmetic operations:
					addition, multiplication, etc
				logical operations:
					AND, OR, XOR, etc
ALU example:
	Operates on two 16-bit two's complement values:
		x,y
	Outputs one 16-bit two's complement value
	Which function to compute is set by six 1 bit inputs:
		zx:
			If zx is 1, then x=0
		nx:
			if nx is 1 then x = NOT(x)
		zy:
			If zy is 1 then y = 0 
		ny:
			If ny is 1 then y = NOT(x)
		f:
			if f is 1 then out = x + y
			if f is 0 then out = AND(x,y)
		no:
			if no is 1 then out = NOT(out)	
	Computes one out of a family of 18 functions
	Also outputs two 1 bit values:
		zr:
			if out = 0 then zr = 1
		ng:
			if out is negative then ng = 1
		Used in computer architecture
