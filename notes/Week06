CHALLENGE:
	write an assembler in shell and in python
Basic Assembler Logic:
	Repeat, until end-of-file is reached:
		Read the next assembly language command:
			Ignore white space
			Read a line as an array of characters
		Break it into the different fields it is composed of:
		Lookup the binary code for each field 
		Combine these codes into a single machine language command 
		Output this machine language command
Symbols:
	Continue writing later
	Labels:
		Forward references:
			Label called on before defined
			possible solutions:
				leave blank until label appears then fix
				in first pass just figure out all addresses
	Variables:
		Assemblers must replace names with address
		Table with the variable and the address 
Assembly program elements:
	White space / indentation
	Line comments
	In-Line comments
	Instruction
		A-instructions
		C-instructions
	Symbols:
		References 
		Label Declarations
