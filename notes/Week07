VM Abstractions (The Stack):
	Balance must be set:
		VM language should be high-level so it's easier to translate the high-level code to vm code
		VM language should be low-level so it's easier to translate between machine code and vm code
	Stack machine abstraction:
		Stack operations:
			push:
				add a value at the stack's top
			pop:
				remove the top value and write that value to memory
		Stack arithmetic:
			Add:
				pop top two values, add them, then push to stack
			Neg:
				negate top most value
			Applying a function f on the stack:
				pops the arguments(s) from the stack
				computes f on the arguments
				pushes the result onto the stack
